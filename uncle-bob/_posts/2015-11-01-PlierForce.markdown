I was sitting on the throne this morning, my iPhone in my hand, idly perusing the stream of random blather that is Facebook; when my eyes landed upon [this post](https://medium.com/@kevlinhenney/unfortunately-the-teacher-was-incorrect-f82d74f3f638#.gv57h4o3z) by Kevlin Henney.  

As I followed his link, and then the next, and the next, I began to realize the dreadful truth; the horrible situation we are all in.  The blood drained from my face.  My body shook.  The iPhone nearly fell into -- nevermind.  

The implications of this are no less than _galactolyptic_.  

> In the statement `5 X 3` we don't know which number is the multiplier and which is the multiplicand!

_Holy Mathematical Syntax Batman!_ I thought this was solved years ago.  When I was in third grade my teacher, Mrs. Moe, told me that the first number was the multiplicand and the second was the multiplier.  That `5 X 3` meant `5 + 5 + 5` and not `3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3`.  In the following 54 years, I have not had any reason to doubt that fact.  Indeed, I have written many computer programs that used that labeling.  

>`int multiply(int multiplicand, int multiplier)`

Kevlin argues that there is no order since both 5 and 3 are simply factors.  But that flies in the face of history!  I mean, the words _multiplier_ and _multiplicand_ were chosen for a _reason_!  After all, look at the other operators:

 * `1 + 2`: `1` and `2` are both _addends_.
 * `1 / 2`: `1` is the _dividend_ and `2` is the _divisor_.
 * `1 - 2`: `1` is the _minuend_ and `2` is the _subtrahend_

Notice how those wise men communicated the commutativity of addition by giving both operands the same name!  But they did _not_ do that for multiplication because they understood that the two operands of multiplication are not interchangeable, and should be distinguished from one another.

However, not one to rely on past third grade teachers, or Kevlin Henney, for matters of such galactic import, I began to do some research.  I found authoritative source after authoritative source, _Britannica_, _Merriam Webster_, _Wikipedia_, _Dictionary.com_, _Ask.com_, _Wolfram Alpha_, _The Onion_, you name it!  Each source confidently declared, asserted, demanded, and bloviated about which operand was the multiplier and which was the multiplicand.  But they all said something different!

Great heavens above, _The Internet did not agree!_

In fact I found three completely contradictory rules.  

1. The first number is the multiplicand.
2. The second number is the multiplicand.
3. The larger of the two is the multiplicand.

(That last rule is likely written by some old PDP-8 programmer.)

This is hair raising.  Which is it?  No one seems to agree!

But perhaps we can apply logic.  Perhaps, by the force of sheer reason and intellect, we can work out the proper ordering of these two parameters.  If not; then we must henceforth eliminate the two terms and simply call the parameters of multiplication _factors_. 

Oh what a dry and colorless place this world would be without the joyful melody, the childlike impudence, of "multiplier" and "multiplicand".

So let us examine this statement in intense detail:

>`5 X 3`

If we say this in _English_ we get:

>_Five times three_.

Aha!  Now we see the problem.  The associativity is ambiguous.  This might mean:

> _five (times three)_ 

or it might mean:

> _(five times) three_.  

And as we all know, English verbs need not be associative.  Right?  I mean _(I dug) a hole_ parses differently than _I (dug a hole)_.

I guess the real question is this.  In the sentence: _Five times three_ which is the subject and which is the predicate?

Now, unless you are Yoda, subjects come first.  So we should parse this as "(Five times) three"  Right?  I mean the subject applies the verb to the direct object.  

To make this clearer, try saying it the way Yoda would say it.  First say "_I go to the store_" the way Yoda would.  Feel the rhythm of it.  "_To the store I go._"  Note the odd inflection on the word "_store_".  In yodese, that inflection is the denotation marker of the direct object.  The nature of that inflection is three tones emitted in rapid succession while vocalizing the vowel.  "_To the sto-o-ore, I go_."  The three tones are connected in an arch that starts at the frequency of 'the' then rises a full note, and then descends a half note. 

Say it over and over.  "_Sto-o-ore_".  The intonation is almost like you were in the middle of asking a question, but then realized the answer and finished with a conclusion.  

OK, now, try that with _five times three_.  You should get _Thre-e-e, five times_.  Can you hear the difference?   

So _five_ must be the multiplier!  My third grade teacher was wrong.  Yoda be praised!  We know the answer!

But wait.  Something just occurred to me.  The word "_times_" is not a verb.  

>_OH!  MY!  GOD!_

The word "_times_" is not a _verb_.  It's a preposition -- a goddam _preposition_!  The bane of all English students.  The enigma of the English Language.  The most ambiguous of all the parts of speech.  The part of speech that almost all students are confused by, and go to detention for.

The word itself is an oxymoron.  A _pre_ _position_.  A position before any other positions.  What kind of nonsense is that?  If we took that literally, all prepositions would come before the Big Bang; and we know that _nothing_ came before the Big Bang, because that's when time started; or at least became non-imaginary...

Anyway, the sentence: "Fives times three." is not a sentence at all; it's a -- I'm not sure I can say it -- _prepositional phrase_! 

And here's the thing about prepositions... They aren't transitive.  They don't convey action.  They don't separate a subject from a predicate.  They are (gasp) _order independent_...  I mean, FTW (for the win) can be completely inverted!

OK, deep breath.  Is there a way that we can convert `5 x 3` into an English sentence, without the preposition?   Can we create a true sentence with a subject and a predicate, where the predicate has a verb and a direct object?  Let's try this:

>_Five is multiplied by 3._

Now _that_ is a sentence.  "_Five_" is the subject.  "_is Multiplied by three_" is the predicate.  And in that predicate, "_is Multiplied by_" is the verb phrase, and "_three_" is the direct object.   

Oh, Hallelujah, we have a sentence.  A parseable, meaningful, unambiguous sentence. 

And it even works when Yoda says it: "_By thre-e-e is five multiplied_".  

In fact when Yoda says it, the meaning is even clearer.  Five is the number being multiplied.  Three is the number by which five is multiplied.  It is the multiplication of five, and the number of multiplications is three.     

When multiplying five by three, three shalt be the number of thy multiplying, and the number of they multiplying shalt be three.  Thou shalt multiply the number five, and five shalt be the number that thouest multiply -- and fill the Earth.   _Eayesudominay!_

Therefore,  _Five is the multiplicand and three is the multiplier_.  Mrs. Moe was right after all!   

Hurray for third grade teachers!
